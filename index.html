            <p>In December 2015 I registered for the NYC Marathon for the fourth time...and I won an entry!
                Here is my journey to the 2017 NYC Marathon starting line.</p>

            <h2>The Lottery</h2>
                <p>Entering the lottery seems like an impossible task.This was my fourth time entering and as soon as I 
                    submitted my entry I had resigned myself to the fact that I probably wasn't going to win a spot in 
                    the race.  The official chances of winning a spot are slim.  Each year, roughly 100,000 people sign 
                    up for the lottery and ony about 14,000 are selected to run the race.

            <h2>Drawing Day</h2>
                <p>The Lottery drawing took place in March 2016.  Even though my hopes were not high, I repeatedly checked
                    my marathong account to see if there were any updates. When there were no updates I would check my credit card statement
                    to see if I had been charged the mandatory race fee.  Entrants tend to see their cards charged before seeing their
                    marathon account updated.  Most of the morning went as expected. I would check, not see anything and then check again 5 
                    minutes later. I checked with friends and family who had also entered and all said the same, no luck.  Then finally 
                    late in the morning I checked my credit card and I had been charged!  I have never been so happy to have my 
                    card charged. It didn't seem real, I refused to accept that I would be running the race until I got the official email, 
                    and around 10pm, the email arrived in my inbox.  I would be running the 2016 NYC Marathon...or so I thought.
