            <p>In December 2015 I registered for the NYC Marathon for the fourth time...and I won an entry!
                Here is my journey to the 2017 NYC Marathon starting line.</p>

            <h2>The Lottery</h2>
                <p>Entering the lottery seems like an impossible task.This was my fourth time entering and as soon as I 
                    submitted my entry I had resigned myself to the fact that I probably wasn't going to win a spot in 
                    the race.  The official chances of winning a spot are slim.  Each year, roughly 100,000 people sign 
                    up for the lottery and ony about 14,000 are selected to run the race.

            <h2>Drawing Day</h2>
                <p>The Lottery drawing took place in March 2016.  Even though my hopes were not high, I repeatedly checked
                    my marathong account to see if there were any updates. When there were no updates I would check my credit card statement
                    to see if I had been charged the mandatory race fee.  Entrants tend to see their cards charged before seeing their
                    marathon account updated.  Most of the morning went as expected. I would check, not see anything and then check again 5 
                    minutes later. I checked with friends and family who had also entered and all said the same, no luck.  Then finally 
                    late in the morning I checked my credit card and I had been charged!  I have never been so happy to have my 
                    card charged. It didn't seem real, I refused to accept that I would be running the race until I got the official email, 
                    and around 10pm, the email arrived in my inbox.  I would be running the 2016 NYC Marathon...or so I thought.

            <h2>Training</h2>
                <p>When I entered the lottery I was nursing an injury.  I figured by the time it came time to start raining
                    I would be healed and ready to go.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  I was never able to fully train 
                    for the race.  As a result, I opted to forego my entry in the 2016 race and push it out a year to 2017.  I 
                    started trainin in July of this year and so far it is going well.  I spend most of my freetime either running
                    or working on Launchcode.

            <h2>Race Day</h2>
                <p>The race is on November 4th this year.  There will be about 50,000 runners participating.  It starts in Staten Island and traverses across all five New
                    York City bouroughs. The race course is lined with millions of spectators making it one of the most 
                    sought after races to run.
